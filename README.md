# Rex Ying's Thesis
Here you could find Rex Ying's Ph.D. Thesis at Stanford University, advised by Jure Leskovec.

## Towards Expressive and Scalable Deep Representation Learning for Graphs
My Ph.D. Thesis revolves around graph representation learning. Specifically, we discuss the use of expressive, scalable and explainable graph neural networks on structured data, and demonstrate its applications in social platforms , biological networks and physical simulations.
